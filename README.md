My first electronic project (2021) of sth more than few leds working with Arduino. It is RC car stand on ATMEGA328P connected with ATTiny by wireless modul. 
Bigger one controlls engine and servo work. Construction made from sheet metal last minute. 

Used components, among others:

Deck:
  - ATMEGA328P
  - Li-Pol 1300mAh 30C
  - LM7805 voltage regulator
  - nRF24L01
  - LDO 3,3V LD1117V33
  - Servo SG-90
  - 2x Engine N20-BT05 micro 50:1 625RPM - 12V
  - L293D

Joystick:
  - ATTINY13A
  - LDO 3,3V LD1117V33
  - Thumb Joystick with button

Construction:
  - metal sheets (from washing mashine, CAD model previously prepared in Inventor)
  - simple axles 3mm
  - bearings
  - wheels

Future plan is to made construction with my 3D printer and upgrade control code.
