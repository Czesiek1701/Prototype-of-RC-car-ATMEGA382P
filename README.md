# Prototype-of-RC-car-ATMEGA382P

My first electronic project (2021) of sth more than few leds working with Arduino. It is prototype of RC car stand on ATMEGA328P connected with ATTiny by wireless modul. 
Bigger one controlls engine and servo work. Construction made from sheet metal last minute. 

## Used components, among others:

### Deck:
  - ATMEGA328P
  - Li-Pol 1300mAh 30C
  - LM7805 voltage regulator
  - nRF24L01
  - LDO 3,3V LD1117V33
  - Servo SG-90
  - 2x Engine N20-BT05 micro 50:1 625RPM - 12V
  - L293D

### Joystick:
  - ATTINY13A
  - LDO 3,3V LD1117V33
  - Thumb Joystick with button

### Car body:
  - metal sheets (from washing mashine, CAD model previously prepared in Inventor)
  - simple axles 3mm
  - bearings
  - wheels

## Futures
Future plan is to made construction with my 3D printer,upgrade control code and reduce the size of wires.
